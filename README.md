### The Zero-Trust Sandbox Browser

SafeLink Local Shield is an Android security browser designed to protect users from mobile banking malware, phishing links, and remote access trojans (RATs). It operates on a "Zero-Download" policy and utilizes Real-time Threat Intelligence to block malicious URLs instantly.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Zero-Download Sandbox:** Automatically blocks all file downloads (.apk, .exe) to prevent malware installation.

* **Real-time Intelligence:** Syncs with global phishing databases (800,000+ entries) to block threats instantly.

* **DOM Content Inspector:** Scans webpage content for suspicious keywords (e.g., "OTP", "รหัส ATM") and insecure password fields.

* **Privacy Curtain & Anti-Spy:** Prevents screen capturing and hides app content from remote control tools.

* **Local-First Heuristics:** Detects typosquatting (fake bank URLs) and IP-based URLs using on-device logic.
